##Logging
To show the log stream on your command line.

	adb logcat

##Filter by tagname

	adb logcat -s TAG_NAME

>example

	adb logcat -s TEST MYAPP

##Filter by priority
To show logs of a specific priority warning and above.

	adb logcat "*:PRIORITY"

>example

	adb logcat "*:W"

Here are the priority levels:

 - V - Verbose (lowest priority) 
 - D - Debug 
 - I - Info 
 - W - Warning 
 - E -  Error 
 - F - Fatal 
 - S - Silent 
(highest priority, on which nothing is ever printed)

##Filter by tagname and priority

    adb logcat -s TAG_NAME:PRIORITY
    adb logcat -s TAG_NAME_1:PRIORITY TAG_NAME_2:PRIORITY

>example

    adb logcat -s TEST: W

##Filter using grep
Alternatively the output of logcat can be piped to grep on a system that supports it.

    adb logcat | grep "SEARCH_TERM"
    adb logcat | grep "SEARCH_TERM_1\|SEARCH_TERM_2"

>example

    adb logcat | grep "Exception"
    adb logcat | grep "Exception\|Error"

##Clearing the logcat buffer
Use this to clear the buffer to remove any old log data.

    adb logcat -c
